Three.js rendering classes for World of Warcraft model formats.

## Usage

To install Wowser Scene:

```sh
npm install @wowserhq/scene
```

Wowser Scene has two dependencies: it uses `@wowserhq/format` to load model formats, and `three`
to render said formats in modern browsers using WebGL 2. There is no use of native modules.
